For my final project, I would like to create a model of Jupiter with its largest moons. Each moon will be rendered with unique textures appropriate to the object. I intend to use Three.js to accomplish this. Jupiter and each of its moons will rotate on their respective axes, and the moons will orbit jupiter at the appropriate distance.

Stretch Goals: I will also render the rings of jupiter and, when the user mouses over an object, it will display that object's name
(Jupiter, Io, Titan, Europa, etc.)
