For my final project, I would like to create a model of Jupiter with its largest moons. Each moon will be rendered with unique textures appropriate to the object. I intend to use Three.js to accomplish this. Jupiter and each of its moons will rotate on their respective axes, and the moons will orbit jupiter at the appropriate distance.

Stretch Goals: I will also render the rings of jupiter and, when the user mouses over an object, it will display that object's name
(Jupiter, Io, Titan, Europa, etc.)

Process:
Week 1: Collect information on the planets, get a list of moons I'm going to use, and review the topics I'll need to complete this project (texturing, transforms, mouse input, etc)
Week 2: Model and Texture Jupiter
Week 3: Position, model, and texture each of Jupiter's moons
Week 4: Add rotations and spins for each object in the scene
Week 5: Begin work on stretch goals (rings and mouseover information)
