For my final project, I would like to render Jupiter, along with several of its moons, in orbit around the larger planet. Each moon will be rendered with unique textures appropriate to the object. I intend to use Three.js to accomplish this.

Stretch Goals: I will also render the rings of jupiter and, when the user mouses over an object, it will display that object's name
(Jupiter, Io, Titan, Europa, etc.)
